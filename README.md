This C++ project is a BMP Filters Pack that processes grayscale .bmp images using nine different filters. The available filters include a Black & White Filter, Invert Colors Filter, and a Merge Filter that combines two images. It also features a Flip Filter (horizontally or vertically), Darken and Lighten Filter to adjust brightness, and a Rotate Filter for rotating images by 90°, 180°, or 270°. The Mirror Half Filter creates a mirrored effect on half of the image, while the Shuffle Filter rearranges image sections randomly. Finally, a Blur Filter adds a softening effect to reduce image details. This project demonstrates my skills in image processing, algorithm design, and C++ programming, with a focus on efficient manipulation of raw image data.
